[{"content":"Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.\n2nd paragraph. Italic, bold, and monospace. Itemized lists look like:\nthis one that one the other one Note that \u0026mdash; not considering the asterisk \u0026mdash; the actual text content starts at 4-columns in.\nBlock quotes are written like so.\nThey can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.\nUse 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s all in chapters 12\u0026ndash;14\u0026rdquo;). Three dots \u0026hellip; will be converted to an ellipsis. Unicode is supported. â˜º\nAn h2 header #Here\u0026rsquo;s a numbered list:\nfirst item second item third item Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters from the left side). Here\u0026rsquo;s a code sample:\n# Let me re-iterate ... for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) } As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:\ndefine foobar() { print \u0026#34;Welcome to flavor country!\u0026#34;; } (which makes copying \u0026amp; pasting easier). You can optionally mark the delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:\nimport time # Quick, count to ten! for i in range(10): # (but not *too* quick) time.sleep(0.5) print i An h3 header #Now a nested list:\nFirst, get these ingredients:\ncarrots celery lentils Boil some water.\nDump everything in the pot and follow this algorithm:\nfind wooden spoon uncover pot stir cover pot balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle wait 10 minutes goto first step (or shut off burner when done) Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.\nNotice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including that last line which continues item 3 above).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a link to a website, to a local doc, and to a section heading in the current doc. Here\u0026rsquo;s a footnote 1.\nTables can look like this:\nsize material color\n9 leather brown 10 hemp canvas natural 11 glass transparent\nTable: Shoes, their sizes, and what they\u0026rsquo;re made of\n(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports multi-line tables:\nkeyword text\nred Sunsets, apples, and other red or reddish things.\ngreen Leaves, grass, frogs and other things it\u0026rsquo;s not easy being.\nA horizontal rule follows.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a definition list:\napples : Good for making applesauce. oranges : Citrus! tomatoes : There\u0026rsquo;s no \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo; in tomatoe.\nAgain, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each term/definition pair to spread things out more.)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;line block\u0026rdquo;:\n| Line one | Line too | Line tree\nand images can be specified like so:\nAn exemplary image Inline math equations go in like so: $\\omega = d\\phi / dt$. Display math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:\n$$I = \\int \\rho R^{2} dV$$\nAnd note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.\nFootnote text goes here.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"3 September 2024","permalink":"/posts/markdown-examples/","section":"Posts","summary":"Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.","title":"Markdown Examples"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"Welcome to A Cloud Packet!
