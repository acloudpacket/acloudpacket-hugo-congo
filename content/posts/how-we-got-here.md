## Introduction

Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening -

This is a story of how [**acloudpacket.com**](https://acloudpacket.com) came to life. I've been working in Information Technology field for the last 20+ years and have dabbled in the web many times. 

First, it was to help a good friend of mine create a music site back in my days at Penn State.

Then for my sister and my brother in-law for their business ventures.
